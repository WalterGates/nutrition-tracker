## To do:

- Fix the drop-down fuzzy-find widget
- Make table header taller, it seems to be possible

## Done:

- Serialize the meal data
- Add input field for the name of the meal, maybe add one more for a description or notes, just like the git commit interface
- Try to refactor the `on_update()` function by splitting it up in multiple, simpler widgets
- Add nutrition summary at the bottom of the window
- Fixed the bug where adjusting the fields of a table row caused the other fields to have incorrect values
- Create a git repository for this project
